# Connect Four


This repo is for the Connect Four project from The Odin Project's Ruby course.

This is a command-line version of the classic Connect Four game, in which 2 players
are provided with a 7x7 grid, and to win, a player has to connect 4 of their own tokens
in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

For this project, the goal was to learn how to use TDD (Test Driven Development) with
RSpec. I feel that I started okay, writing tests for each method I wanted to implement, and
then writing that method's implementation. But as I got further into the project, I
refactored a lot of code which made it so that the tests are no longer passing, instead
of writing tests for the changes I wanted to implement, and then implementing the changes.

Writing tests had me stumped initially when I heard about mocks/stubs/doubles, but making use
of them in this project allowed me to grasp the concepts very quickly.

Overall, there is a lot I have to improve, but I am fairly happy with the result of this project.
